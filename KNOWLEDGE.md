# Craft

**Ship these. They are what made the real apps feel finished.**

- Home **is** the mechanic (canvas, rings, tower, wheel, matrix, dial, board, console). A tab plus a list of records is a clone.
- One persisted verb on home. Unit-test that verb. A decorative Game / Aura / Circuit / Nest / Sweep tab is filler — do not ship one.
- Every primary list has an empty state: generated art, one headline, one line, one CTA as a **full page** (`frame(maxHeight: .infinity)`). A crumb in a `Spacer` fails.
- Screens fill the device. Unused flat field, a narrow text column, or a header-plus-void overlay is a fail. Edge-to-edge rows; the writing surface / list / hero uses remaining height. iPad uses the width. Simulator seed shows a **used** product (several cards, several lines of ink), not one stub row.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Chrome lives **inside** the `Button` label with `.contentShape`. Min ~44pt. Rows, chips, cards, tab columns: one target.
- Onboarding Next / Continue / START is bottom, full width — not a 36pt control in the corner.
- Simulator seed only, once, behind a versioned key. Never seed on a device. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed so home is not empty. Seeded home: primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture, not the first frame.
- Background fills the safe area (no white strips). Tab bar sits on the home indicator; lists use `contentMargins(.bottom)`.
- Contact URL on Settings (or Goals). App Review looks for it.
- Offline: if the product needs a catalog, a local shelf must catch empty/fail search. A spinner forever fails.
- Denied camera (when used) explains the state and routes to Settings. Silent no-op fails.
- Numbers go through `NumberFormatter`. Day edges use `Calendar.current.startOfDay`.
- One haptic on a successful commit, none on navigation.
- VoiceOver labels on every icon-only control. Colour is never the only signal.

**Review screenshots (21AUG App02–09)**

The running app, not `ImageRenderer`. One launch argument, three keys:

- `-ReviewScreen today` — home after onboarding (often a no-op)
- `-ReviewScreen log` — log / statement / planner
- `-ReviewScreen goals` — goals / targets / profile

Read `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` **once**, **after** onboarding is done.
If onboarding is still showing, the hook never fires. The three keys must open
three **different** screens — same frame on today/log/goals is a miss.

Companion (Simulator only):

- Seed one demo day behind a versioned key (`{prefix}.demo.v1`).
- Mark onboarding complete in the same seed so the hook is reachable.
- `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`. Never seed on a device.
- Seed fills the primary surface (four slot posts from the local shelf).
- Seed the happy path: home primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture.

Driver (outside the app): build → install on iPhone and iPad → launch with the
argument → wait until the UI settles → `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`.
Name files `{App}-{today|log|goals}.png`. Pick any available simulator UDID.

**The frame is the product. Rebuild a wrong screen. Do not patch pixels over it.**

- A stranger names the job and the next tap from home. A riddle headline fails.
- Seeded home: primary CTA enabled. Fake tappable cards and axis values as titles fail.
- Home **is** the mechanic, not a list of records. An empty or one-color frame fails.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Min ~44pt. `contentShape` on the fill.
- Unused canvas / narrow column — fill with this app's mechanic, not Spacer.
- Empty and onboarding are full pages, CTA at the bottom full width.
- Seed only Simulator + versioned key. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed.
- Background fills the safe area. Contact URL on Settings.

**Family `sideline_stats`**
- Home: Landscape ON-AIR console: home | clock/score | away + live tape.
- Invariant (unit-test this): Clock = accumulated + now−runStartedAt (no tick drift). One-tap Goal/Foul/card/Sub. Undo last. PDF after.
- Empty: No match yet. Start the clock.
- Fake that fails: A post-game form, or betting.
- Never: No Reflex Call mini-game. Not a betting product.

**Desk `group_ellipse` — Archery 1σ group**
- Home: Tap-to-place target face.
- Invariant (unit-test this): Covariance ellipse; flyer if dist/semiMajor>2.5; sightCorrection=(−cx,−cy). Keep x,y.
- Fake that fails: Ring counts only.
